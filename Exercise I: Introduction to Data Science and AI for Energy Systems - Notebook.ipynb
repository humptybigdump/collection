    "A central element of this lecture is the analysis of empirical data. In this exercise, we introduce some analysis methods to an empirical time series of frequency measurement data. In especially we focus on some important indicators of frequency stability, namely the largest frequency deviation (Nadir), the aggregated deviation (integral), the mean-square-displacement (MSD) and the largest change of frequency (RoCoF = rate of change of frequency). <br>\n",
    "Given a time series of frequency deviation data (i.e. a time series of frequency data minus the reference frequency), we calculate the indicators for certain time intervals $$I_i = \\{t_i,t_{i+1}+\\tau,\\ldots,t_i+\\tau \\gamma\\},$$ where $\\tau$ is the time resolution, $\\gamma$ represents the size of the interval, and $t_i$ is the starting point of the $i\\text{th}$ interval.<br>\n",
    "In our example, we consider hourly time steps with $\\gamma = 3600$, a time resolution $\\tau = 1\\text{s}$, and $t_i$ denotes the start of the $i\\text{th}$ hour of the data.\n",
