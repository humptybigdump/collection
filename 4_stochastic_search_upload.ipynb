    "# Exercise 4  **Stochastic Search (15 Pts)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is about Stochastic Search methods for blackbox function optimization. In contrast to many Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms, Stochastic Search Methods do not rely on any assumptions like the Markov property. As such, they are a highly flexible class of algorithms that can be very powerful in different scenarios. In this homework, we will implement a Canonical Evolutionary Strategy (CES) and the Cross Entropy Method (CEM) as two examples of Stochastic Search Methods. Further, we will look at the math behind MOdel-based Relative Entropy Stochastic Search (MORE), showing how Lagrangian optimization can be used to efficiently optimize a Gaussian search distribution with full covariance.\n",
