    "Generally, the ray parameter is estimated by the derivative of travel time curves. Those curves were determined by measuring the arrival time of earthquake phases at multiple stations, which are spread over the globe. With the advantage of data of a seismic array, we can simplify the determination of the ray parameter! <br>\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
