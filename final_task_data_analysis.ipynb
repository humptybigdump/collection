    "For this part you are provided with a data set contained in the file 'data_final_task_regression.csv'. The data contains information on regional averages of low-cloud occurrence and meteorological factors in the Southeast Atlantic (10°S-20°S, 0°E-10°E - this means that the study area is about 1000 km x 1000 km large). The DataFrame contains the following variables:\n",
    "- sst: sea surface temperature\n",
    "- eis: estimated inversion strength\n",
    "- t_adv: temperature advection\n",
    "- w700: vertical pressure velocity at 700 hPa (this is the vertical wind speed, given in Pa/s: positive numbers mean subsiding air masses)\n",
    "- rhft: relative humidity in the free troposphere (free troposphere is above the cloud layer)\n",
    "- clf: Liquid water cloud fraction\n",

    "The data on clouds are from a satellite data set from the MODIS sensor on board NASA's Terra satellite.

    "For the second part of the exercise, you are tasked to develop a machine learning method to detect fog and low clouds for a location in the Namib Desert on the basis of observations from a geostationary satellite platform. You are provided a data set (ILIAS: 'data_final_task_classification.csv') of night-time satellite observations at different wave lengths over a meteorological measurement station. The geostationary satellite (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager; SEVIRI) makes a scan every 15 minutes at a spatial resolution of 3km x 3km. For the exact time steps of the satellite observations made available here, a boolean (True/False) data set on the presence of fog and low clouds from the measurement station is provided, which should be used as the labeled target data.\n",
