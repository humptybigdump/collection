Select the vertical component, multiply the data by the same amplitude conversion factor as above (station uses same instrumentation as STG8) and trim the trace. Starttime should again be source time, and when trimming the data try to include the earthquake signal as complete as possible. Then filter the data to increase signal to noise ratio.
