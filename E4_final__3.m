%% Task 1: Generating soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity curves of three soils

% select soil hydraulic parameters from Table 1

ths = [0.43,0.45,0.36];   % Porosity of the soil, water content at saturation
alpha = [14.5,2.0,0.5];  % Air entry value in 1/m

% define array with soil water content from thr to ths with delt_theta step
% size of 10^-7. For the theta values in this array, you subsequently
% calculate the corresponding k(theta) and psi(theta) values
theta=[thr(i):10e-7:ths(i)];   

% Calculate psi with converted Eq. 1
S = (theta - thr(i)) / (ths(i) - thr(i)); % relative saturation

%psi_2 = -1 * ((((1 ./ S) .^ (1 ./ m_vg(i))) - 1) .^ (1 ./ n_vg(i))) .* (1 ./ alpha(i));
% same psi values but different equation

% Calculate k with Eq. 2
k = ks(i) .* S .^ 0.5 .* (1 - (1 - S .^ (1 ./ m_vg(i))) .^ m_vg(i)) .^ 2;

% Calculation of effetive field capacity of soil:
% definition of psi (m) at PWP and FC
psi_PWP = 150;
psi_FC = 0.68;

% 1: calculate relative saturation S at PWP
S_PWP = (1 ./ (1 + (abs(psi_PWP) .* alpha(i)) .^ n_vg(i))) .^ m_vg(i);

% 2: calculate soil water content theta at PWP
theta_PWP = thr(i) + (S_PWP * (ths(i) - thr(i)));

% 3: calculate relative saturation S at FC
S_FC = (1 ./ (1 + (abs(psi_FC) .* alpha(i)) .^ n_vg(i))) .^ m_vg(i);

% 4: calculate soil water content theta at FC
theta_FC = thr(i) + S_FC * (ths(i) - thr(i));

% 5: calculate effective field capacity with Eq. 3
eff_FC = theta_FC - theta_PWP

%% Task 2: Sensitivity of soil water retention curves of different soils to alpha
% Use your code from Task 1, play around with the parameter Î± (e.g., try equal high and low values for all soil types) and run the code again.  
% for example: try alpha = 0.5, or alpha = 15.50 for all three soil types.
% What can you see compared to the previous soil water retention curves of
% the three soil types from Task 1?

% answer: alpha is the matric suction from which air starts to penetrate
% into the soil. Typically, the finer particles the higher alpha or,
% respectively, the lower the inverse of alpha (1/m) as given in Table 1.
% The inverse value is used because of the syntax of Eq. 1.
% This means: fine soils (clay) generally need a higher matric suction to
% start the desaturation process with penetrating of air into soil. Thus, their
% air entry value is high or ,respectively, their inverse of alpha is low. 
% In consequence, they can hold more water at a certain matric suction.
