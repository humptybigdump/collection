    "The classification of handwritten digits is a standard problem in the field of image classification. In this exercise, we will process labeled images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset in order to train and test (deep) neural networks on this task. The goal of this exercise is for you to dive into a state-of-the-art software package for large-scale deep learning, to experiment with your own neural-network designs, and to compare your results with modern setups.\n",

The core concept of TensorFlow is the representation of the information flow as tensors in a graph. In this exercise, the wrapper Keras is used, which hides this concept to a large extent and makes the library much easier to use.\n",

Execute the script `download_dataset.py` to download and extract the dataset as binary.

Also specified in the code are the loss function, the optimizer, and the validation metrics used for the training. The full documentation is available on the Keras webpage (www.keras.io)."
