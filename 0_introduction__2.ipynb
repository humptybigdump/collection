    "For the submission of the exercise please follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure that every cell is executed and that your plots are properly displayed and saved.\n",
    "2. Create a .zip file of your filled-in notebook, a potential pen & paper solution\n",
    "(for some exercises only), and the folder containing your saved plots.\n",
    "By default, the plot folder will be in your Google Drive in *drl_ws21/exercise_i/date* for the i-th exercise\n",
    "3. Rename your zip file with the following naming convention: group_y_uxxxx_uxxxx_uxxxx\n",
    "where y is your group number, uxxxx is the kit user from each group member/\n",

    " Each cell can be run separately to present the text properly or to execute the code.\n",
    "It is also possible to use $\\LaTeX$ equations inside the markdown environment.\n",
    "You can freely edit the code in the code-cells, and then compile a cell by\n",
    "clicking on the arrow next to it.\n",
    "Code that has been compiled in one cell (such as functions, classes or imports) is available in other cells.\n",

    "For the exercises, you will be provided with an incomplete algorithm and\n",

    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an automatic differentiation framework that builds on NumPy. It offers a wide range of tools and pre-build blocks for different machine learning approaches. We will mainly use PyTorch for the *deep* part of Deep Reinforcement Learning, i.e., to build and train deep neural networks.\n",
    "* To get started with PyTorch, we recommend [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)."
