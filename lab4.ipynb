Any conclusions or claims are made exclusively on the basis of corpus observations. In practise you create dictionaries and occurences based upon the corpus itself e.g. you count number of words or create language phrases from the text (by n-grams - see below).

       " 'He wrote more than three-quarters of extant Latin literature that is known to have existed in his lifetime, and it has been said that subsequent prose was either a reaction against or a return to his style, not only in Latin but in European languages up to the 19th century.',\n",
       " 'Cicero introduced into Latin the arguments of the chief schools of Hellenistic philosophy and created a Latin philosophical vocabulary with neologisms such as evidentia, humanitas, qualitas, quantitas, and essentia, distinguishing himself as a translator and philosopher.Though he was an accomplished orator and successful lawyer, Cicero believed his political career was his most important achievement.',\n",
       " 'It was during his consulship that the second Catilinarian conspiracy attempted to overthrow the government through an attack on the city by outside forces, and Cicero suppressed the revolt by summarily and controversially executing five conspirators without trial.',\n",

       " \"It was precisely his broad education that tied him to the traditional Roman elite.Cicero's interest in philosophy figured heavily in his later career and led to him providing a comprehensive account of Greek philosophy for a Roman audience, including creating a philosophical vocabulary in Latin.\",\n",

       " 'Cicero was the only victim of the proscriptions who was displayed in that manner.',\n",
       " \"According to Cassius Dio (in a story often mistakenly attributed to Plutarch), Antony's wife Fulvia took Cicero's head, pulled out his tongue, and jabbed it repeatedly with her hairpin in final revenge against Cicero's power of speech.Cicero's son, Marcus Tullius Cicero Minor, during his year as a consul in 30 BC, avenged his father's death, to a certain extent, when he announced to the Senate Mark Antony's naval defeat at Actium in 31 BC by Octavian and his commander-in-chief, Agrippa.Octavian is reported to have praised Cicero as a patriot and a scholar of meaning in later times, within the circle of his family.\",\n",
       " \"However, it was Octavian's acquiescence that had allowed Cicero to be killed, as Cicero was condemned by the new triumvirate.Cicero's career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate.\",\n",

       " 'The quality and ready accessibility of Ciceronian texts favored very wide distribution and inclusion in teaching curricula, as suggested by a graffito at Pompeii, admonishing: \"You will like Cicero, or you will be whipped\".Cicero was greatly admired by influential Church Fathers such as Augustine of Hippo, who credited Cicero\\'s lost Hortensius for his eventual conversion to Christianity, and St. Jerome, who had a feverish vision in which he was accused of being \"follower of Cicero and not of Christ\" before the judgment seat.This influence further increased after the Early Middle Ages in Europe, which more of his writings survived than any other Latin author.',\n",
       " \"Medieval philosophers were influenced by Cicero's writings on natural law and innate rights.Petrarch's rediscovery of Cicero's letters provided the impetus for searches for ancient Greek and Latin writings scattered throughout European monasteries, and the subsequent rediscovery of classical antiquity led to the Renaissance.\",\n",
       " \"Subsequently, Cicero became synonymous with classical Latin to such an extent that a number of humanist scholars began to assert that no Latin word or phrase should be used unless it appeared in Cicero's works, a stance criticised by Erasmus.His voluminous correspondence, much of it addressed to his friend Atticus, has been especially influential, introducing the art of refined letter writing to European culture.\",\n",
       " 'Cornelius Nepos, the first century BC biographer of Atticus, remarked that Cicero\\'s letters contained such a wealth of detail \"concerning the inclinations of leading men, the faults of the generals, and the revolutions in the government\" that their reader had little need for a history of the period.Among Cicero\\'s admirers were Desiderius Erasmus, Martin Luther, and John Locke.',\n",

       " 'Gibbon wrote of his first experience reading the author\\'s collective works thus: \"I tasted the beauty of the language; I breathed the spirit of freedom; and I imbibed from his precepts and examples the public and private sense of a man...after finishing the great author, a library of eloquence and reason, I formed a more extensive plan of reviewing the Latin classics...\" Voltaire called Cicero \"the greatest as well as the most elegant of Roman philosophers\" and even staged a play based on Cicero\\'s role in the Catilinarian conspiracy, called Rome Sauvée, ou Catilina, to \"make young people who go to the theatre acquainted with Cicero.\"',\n",
       " \"Voltaire was spurred to pen the drama as a rebuff to his rival Claude Prosper Jolyot de Crébillon's own play Catilina, which had portrayed Cicero as a coward and villain who hypocritically married his own daughter to Catiline.\",\n",
       " 'Montesquieu produced his \"Discourse on Cicero\" in 1717, in which he heaped praise on the author because he rescued \"philosophy from the hands of scholars, and freed it from the confusion of a foreign language\".',\n",

       " \"However, contemporaneous descriptions of the building from the excavators combined with Cicero's own references to his Pompeianum differ, making it unlikely that it is Cicero's villa.In Rome, the location of Cicero's house has been roughly identified from excavations of the Republican-era stratum on the northwestern slope of the Palatine Hill.\",\n",
       " \"Cicero's domus has long been known to have stood in the area, according to his own descriptions and those of later authors, but there is some debate about whether it stood near the base of the hill, very close to the Roman Forum, or nearer to the summit.\",\n",
