function matches = feature_matching(I1, I2, num_features, search_area, window_size)
% Detect features in image I1 and find corresponding matches in image I2
% using block matching
% Arguments:
%   I1: left image
%   I2: right image
%   num_features: number of features to detect in I1
%   search_area: [height, width] of search area
%   window_size: [height, width] of window to use to compute the comparison
%                 metric 
% Output: 
%   matrix of size num_features x 4, where each row contains the
%   coordinates of one pair of matched points
