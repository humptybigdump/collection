function particles = pf_init (numParticles, initial_state_cov_matrix)
% Create initial set of numParticles particles around 0 with random 
% deviation given by the covariance matrix initial_state_cov_matrix.
% Each particle should contain in its first column its weight and the 
% other columns its state.
