They didn &apos;t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters . Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley &apos;s sister , but they hadn &apos;t met for several years ; in fact , Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn &apos;t have a sister , because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be . The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street . The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son , too , but they had never even seen him . This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away ; they didn &apos;t want Dudley mixing with a child like that .\n",

      "celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party of special\n",
      "magnificence , there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton .\n",
      "Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar , and had been the\n",
      "wonder of the Shire for sixty years , ever since his remarkable\n",
      "disappearance and unexpected return . The riches he had brought back\n",
      "from his travels had now become a local legend , and it was popularly\n",
      "believed , whatever the old folk might say , that the Hill at Bag End\n",
      "was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure . And if that was not enough\n",
      "for fame , there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at . Time wore\n",
      "on , but it seemed to have little effect on Mr. Baggins . At ninety he\n",
      "was much the same as at fifty . At ninety-nine they began to call him\n",
      "well-preserved ; but unchanged would have been nearer the mark . There\n",
      "were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a\n",
      "good thing ; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess ( apparently )\n",
      "perpetual youth as well as ( reputedly ) inexhaustible wealth .\n",
      "&quot; It will have to be paid for , &quot; they said . &quot; It isn &quot; t natural ,\n",
      "and trouble will come of it ! &quot;\n",
      "\n",
      "But so far trouble had not come ; and as Mr. Baggins was\n",
      "generous with his money , most people were willing to forgive him his\n",
      "oddities and his good fortune . He remained on visiting terms with his\n",
      "relatives ( except , of course , the Sackville-Bagginses ) , and he had\n",
      "many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant\n",
      "families . But he had no close friends , until some of his younger\n",
      "cousins began to grow up .\n",
      "The eldest of these , and Bilbo &quot; s favourite , was young Frodo\n",
      "Baggins . When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir , and\n",
      "brought him to live at Bag End ; and the hopes of the Sackville-\n",
      "Bagginses were finally dashed . Bilbo and Frodo happened to have the\n",
      "same birthday , September 22nd . &quot; You had better come and live here ,\n",
      "Frodo my lad , &quot; said Bilbo one day ; &quot; and then we can celebrate our\n",
      "birthday-parties comfortably together . &quot; At that time Frodo was still\n",
      "in his tweens , as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties\n",
      "between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three .\n",
      "Twelve more years passed . Each year the Bagginses had given\n",
      "very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End ; but now it was\n",
      "understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for\n",
      "that autumn . Bilbo was going to be eleventy-one , 111 , a rather\n",
      "curious number , and a very respectable age for a hobbit ( the Old Took\n",
      "himself had only reached 130 ) ; and Frodo was going to be thirty-\n",
      "three , 33 , an important number : the date of his &quot; coming of age &quot; .\n",
      "Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater ; and rumour of\n",
      "the coming event travelled all over the Shire . The history and\n",
      "character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of\n",
      "conversation ; and the older folk suddenly found their reminiscences\n",
      "in welcome demand .\n",
      "No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee ,\n",
      "commonly known as the Gaffer . He held forth at The Ivy Bush , a small\n",
      "inn on the Bywater road ; and he spoke with some authority , for he had\n",
      "tended the garden at Bag End for forty years , and had helped old\n",
      "Holman in the same job before that . Now that he was himself growing\n",
      "old and stiff in the joints , the job was mainly carried on by his\n",
      "youngest son , Sam Gamgee . Both father and son were on very friendly\n",
      "terms with Bilbo and Frodo . They lived on the Hill itself , in Number\n",
      "3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End .\n",
      "&quot; A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo , as I &quot; ve\n",
      "always said , &quot; the Gaffer declared . With perfect truth : for Bilbo was\n",
      "very polite to him , calling him &quot; Master Hamfast &quot; , and consulting him\n",
      "constantly upon the growing of vegetables â€” in the matter of &quot; roots &quot; ,\n",
      "especially potatoes , the Gaffer was recognized as the leading\n",
      "authority by all in the neighbourhood ( including himself ) .\n",
      "&quot; But what about this Frodo that lives with him ? &quot; asked Old\n",
      "Noakes of Bywater . &quot; Baggins is his name , but he &quot; s more than half a\n",
      "Brandybuck , they say . It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should\n",
      "go looking for a wife away there in Buckland , where folks are so\n",
      "queer . &quot;\n",
      "&quot; And no wonder they &quot; re queer , &quot; put in Daddy Twofoot ( the\n",
      "Gaffer &quot; s next-door neighbour ) , &quot; if they live on the wrong side of the\n",
      "Brandywine River , and right agin the Old Forest . That &quot; s a dark bad\n",
      "place , if half the tales be true . &quot;\n",
      "&quot; You &quot; re right , Dad ! &quot; said the Gaffer . &quot; Not that the\n",
      "Brandybucks of Buckland live in the Old Forest ; but they &quot; re a queer\n",
      "breed , seemingly . They fool about with boats on that big river â€” and\n",
      "that isn &quot; t natural . Small wonder that trouble came of it , I say . But\n",
      "be that as it may , Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could\n",
      "wish to meet . Very much like Mr. Bilbo , and in more than looks . After\n",
      "all his father was a Baggins . A decent respectable hobbit was Mr.\n",
      "Drogo Baggins ; there was never much to tell of him , till he was\n",
      "drownded . &quot;\n",
      "&quot; Drownded ? &quot; said several voices . They had heard this and\n",
      "other darker rumours before , of course ; but hobbits have a passion\n",
      "for family history , and they were ready to hear it again .\n",
      "&quot; Well , so they say , &quot; said the Gaffer . &quot; You see : Mr. Drogo , he\n",
      "married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck . She was our Mr. Bilbo &quot; s first\n",
      "cousin on the mother &quot; s side ( her mother being the youngest of the Old\n",
      "Took &quot; s daughters ) ; and Mr. Drogo was his second cousin . So Mr. Frodo\n",
      "is his first and second cousin , once removed either way , as the\n",
      "saying is , if you follow me . And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall\n",
      "with his father-in-law , old Master Gorbadoc , as he often did after\n",
      "his marriage ( him being partial to his vittles , and old Gorbadoc\n",
      "keeping a mighty generous table ) ; and he went out boating on the\n",
      "Brandywine River ; and he and his wife were drownded , and poor Mr.\n",
      "Frodo only a child and all . &quot;\n",
      "&quot; I &quot; ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the\n",
      "moonlight , &quot; said Old Noakes ; &quot; and it was Drogo &quot; s weight as sunk the\n",
      "boat . &quot;\n",
      "&quot; And I heard she pushed him in , and he pulled her in after\n",

      "talking of pushing and pulling . Boats are quite tricky enough for\n",
      "those that sit still without looking further for the cause of\n",

      "brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall . A regular warren , by all accounts .\n",
