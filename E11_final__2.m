%% Exercise 11: Climate analysis of british catchments with the Budyko framework
%% Task 1: Generating Budkyo diagram and plotting the position of one catchment into Budyko diagram
% import hydrological time series of one arbitrary catchment as table (function:
% "readtable"). Simply choose one of the 50 given catchments.
tab_catchment = readtable('./data/CAMELS_GB_hydromet_timeseries_33028_19701001-20150930.csv');

% saving/assigning precipitation, potential evapotranspiration ('pet'), runoff ('discharge_spec') from
% table to variables/arrays
catchment_precip = table2array(tab_catchment(:,{'precipitation'}));
catchment_pot_evapo = table2array(tab_catchment(:,{'pet'}));
catchment_streamflow = table2array(tab_catchment(:,{'discharge_spec'}));

% the streamflow time series may contain several NaN values. Use the
% function "isnan" to find the index (=positions/rows) in the streamflow time
% series, where we have actual data and no NaN. 
nan_idx = ~isnan(catchment_streamflow);

% calculating position of catchment in Budyko framework:
% Step 1: calculating actual evapotranspiration by closing water balance
% (cf. exercise 1) assuming constant water storage change over the 45
% years. In the following, use the above defined NaN index to only do the
% calculations with actual data and ignoring rows with NaN!
catchment_act_evapo = sum(catchment_precip(nan_idx)) - sum(catchment_streamflow(nan_idx));


% Step 2: calculating aridity index of catchment (Eq. 1)
aridity_index = sum(catchment_pot_evapo(nan_idx))/sum(catchment_precip(nan_idx));

% Step 3: calculating evaporative index of catchment (Eq. 2)
evapo_index = sum(catchment_act_evapo)/sum(catchment_precip(nan_idx));

% Step 4: plot of budyko framework and position of catchment

%% Task 2: Plotting the positions of all given catchments automatically into the Budyko framework
% save list of all available files in folder "data", which start with a "C", in a variable  (function:"dir")

% in Budyko framework of all given catchments, consecutively from first to
% last catchment

  % Step 4 in for-loop: saving/assigning precipitation, potential

  % Step 5 in for-loop: calculating actual evapotranspiration, aridity index and evaporative
  % index of currently selected catchment. Again, use previously defined
  % Nan index to only do the calculations with actual data and no NaN
  catchment_act_evapo = sum(catchment_precip(nan_idx)) - sum(catchment_streamflow(nan_idx));
