    "\n",
    "You can find some detailed information on the jupyter notebook concept in the [documentation of the project](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are some basic instructions:**\n",
    "- Each code block, a so called \"cell\", can be executed by pressing **shift + enter**.\n",
    "- You can run multiple cells by marking them and then pressing **shift + enter** or via the options in the \"Run\" menu in the top bar.\n",
    "- The order of execution matters! The order in which the cells have been executed is indicated by the integers in the brackets to the left of the cell. For instance `In [1]` was executed first. This means that code at the end of the notebook can affect the code at the beginning, if the cells at the beginning are executed after the cells at the end.\n",
    "- You can change between three cell types in Jupyter Lab: \"Code\", \"Markdown\" or \"Raw\".\n",
    "    * The \"Code\" cells will be interpreted by Python.\n",
    "    * The \"Markdown\" cells will be rendered with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and can be used for documentation and text, such as this cell. You can use them for your answers and also add LaTeX formulas such as $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$. If you double click **this** Markdown cell you can see the raw code of this LaTeX equation. By pressing **shift + enter** the cell will be rendered with Markdown again.\n",
    "    * The \"Raw\" cells won't be interpreted at all.\n",
    "- If you want to reset your notebook, to *\"forget\"* all the defined functions, classes and variables, go to `Kernel -> Restart Kernel` in the top bar. Your code and text will remain untouched when doing this.\n",
    "- If you write or read files and provide only the file name, the notebook will look for the file in the directory it is located itself. Use relative paths or absolute paths to read or write files from or to somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some more information on the JupyterLab interface and some useful shortcuts you can check out:\n",
    "- [the JupyterLab interface documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html)\n",

    "#### ROOT Approach:\n",
    "If you want to use `ROOT`, you should check out [`gRandom->Gaus()`](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTRandom.html#a0e445e213eae1343b3d22086ecb87314). You can use this method to [fill](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH1.html#a77e71290a82517d317ea8d05e96b6c4a) a `ROOT` [`TH1F` histogram](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH1F.html) one by one with the random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively you can use the [`FillRandom`](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTH1.html#a1e9d6258ae798a0eb52aef58a72758a5) method to fill the histogram directly with Gaussian distributed numbers, e.g. `my_hist.FillRandom(\"gaus\", 1000)`. If you want to use a ROOT's gauss function with other values for mean and sigma than the default values, you have to define a [one dimensional function `TF1`](https://root.cern.ch/doc/master/classTF1.html) with the respective parameters first:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gaussian = TF1(\"gaussian\",\"gaus\",-3,3)\n",
    "gaussian.SetParameters(1,0,1)  # last parameter is sigma, second to last is the mean of the gaussian.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Plotting with ROOT in jupyter notebooks is a bit tricky, which is why we will give you some detailed hints on how to do this.\n",
    "First of all, the plot will not be shown if it is created in a function. Thus, your function should return the created `TH1F` object and you can then draw it on a canvas:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "canvas = TCanvas(\"c1\", \"c1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "root_histogram = create_gaussian_histogram_with_root(N=1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "root_histogram.Draw()\n",
    "canvas.Modified()\n",
    "canvas.Update()\n",
    "canvas.Draw()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A second problem arises if you try to run the code a second time, because the created ROOT objects are still present in the notebook and jupyter will not be able to create them again unless you delete them first, e.g. with a code snippet such as:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    del canvas\n",
    "except NameError:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will delete the ROOT object `canvas` if it was already created. If it has not been created, yet, the `try`-`except` approach will catch the `NameError` that will be thrown, as the object `canvas` does not exist, yet. In this case nothing will be done (look up what the python build-in keyword `pass` does). You can also restart the jupyter kernel to achieve this, but this is rather inconvenient."

    "#### Python Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy does not provide a dedicated class for histograms as ROOT does. In Exercise 1.1 we created an array containing the random numbers and visualized these numbers as histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use numpy's [`numpy.histogram`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.histogram.html) method to interpret the data as histogram. However, this method will not create or return a \"histogram\" object, it will simply give you the bin counts and the bin edges of the histogram in form of two numpy arrays. You will have to decide yourself how to handle these return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1) Store the data, not the histogram.**\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can use [`numpy.save`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.save.html) or [`pandas.to_hdf`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_hdf.html) (you have to convert your data into the [`pandas.DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) or the [`pandas.Series`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html) format for this) to save the data you created directly. You can also write the data to a csv file or any other format you might be familiar with.\n",
    "Using this option, you have to recreate the histogram again, because you stored the raw data and not the histogram interpretation. This has the advantage of being able to reinterpret the data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Option 2) Define a histogram object that can be stored to a file.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing the data in form of a histogram has two advantages: Firstly, it is clear how the data should be interpreted, and secondly, when handling large amounts of data, the histogram is a storage efficient way to save the data. Instead of saving each individual data point, only the bin count and the bin edges are stored. This means, if you consider a histogram with `n` bins, `2*n+1` (1 bin count per bin -> `n` bin counts; and `n+1` bin edge positions) numbers have to be stored. Keep in mind, however, that the amount of information stored in the histogram is also reduced compared to the full raw data set, as you only store one interpretation of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use Python's [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) to directly dump the tuple of bin counts and bin edges returned by the numpy histogram method to store these python objects in a pickle file. See also the [example given on the python website](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html#examples) which shows how a python dictionary is written and loaded again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of these methods is, that you have to put a bit more effort into defining the object that is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try to implement both options, but focus on the **Option 2)**."
