One can also define a local Peclet number using the mesh resolution $\\Delta x$ as the characteristic length; such local Peclet number will be of crucial importance for the stability of some schemes, as we are about to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Pe_{local} = \\frac{U \\Delta x}{\\kappa} $$\n",

    "### 1. Discretisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretisation is performed in the same way as the previous example; however, it is now necessary to discretise the convective term. To do so, one has two alternatives - namely, using a centered scheme or an upwind one. The centered one reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left( U \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right)_i \\approx U \\frac{T_{i+1}-T_{i-1}}{2\\Delta x} $$\n",

    "which can be rewritten using purposely defined coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left( U \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right)_i \\approx  A_E^c T_{i+1} + A_P^c T_i + A_W^c T_{i-1} $$\n",
    "$$ A_E^c = \\frac{U}{2 \\Delta x}; \\; A_W^c = -\\frac{U}{2 \\Delta x}; \\; A_P^c = - (A_E^c + A_W^c)=0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative is represented by the upwind scheme; this is a forward or backward finite difference that gathers data from the direction of the convective velocity, meaning that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\left( U \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right)_i \\approx U \\frac{T_i - T_{i-1}}{x_i - x_{i-1}}\\ \\text{, if} \\ U > 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\left( U \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\right)_i \\approx U \\frac{T_{i+1} - T_{i}}{x_{i+1} - x_{i}}\\ \\text{, if} \\ U < 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be rewritten in the same form as centered differences, albeit with different coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$  A_E^u = \\frac{min(U,0)}{\\Delta x}; \\; A_W^u = -\\frac{max(U,0)}{\\Delta x}; \\; A_P^u = - (A_E^u + A_W^u) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the stencil changes in case of an upwind scheme; now, information from only 2 grid points is used (meaning that the scheme will be first order).\n",

    "<img src=\"https://git.scc.kit.edu/ar8439/pic-repo/-/raw/master/numerics/finite_diff/upwind_stencil.svg\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"height: 140px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Both alternatives are here implemented; the user selects the desired one with a flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Writing the linear system\n",
    "\n",
    "Discretisation of this system leads again to a system of the type $\\textbf{A} \\vec{T} = \\vec{b}$; in this case, though, $\\vec{b}$ is composed of all zeroes (except for the elements corresponding to boundary conditions). On the other hand, $\\textbf{A}$ is given by the sum of a convective and a diffusive contribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\textbf{A} = \\textbf{A}_{conv} + \\textbf{A}_{diff} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to the previous case, $\\textbf{A}_{diff}$ can be written as (watch out for the coefficient, which in the previous case was shifted to $\\vec{b}$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{A}_{diff} = \\frac{\\kappa}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        ... & & & & & &  \\\\\n",
    "        -1 & 2 & -1 & & & &  \\\\\n",
    "        & -1 & 2 & -1 & & &  \\\\\n",
    "        & & -1 & 2 & -1 & & &  \\\\\n",
    "        & & & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots &  \\\\\n",
    "        & & & & -1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n",
    "        & & & & & & ...\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "whereas the convective term reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{A}_{conv} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "        ... & & & & & &  \\\\\n",
    "        A_W & A_P & A_E & & & &  \\\\\n",
    "        & A_W & A_P & A_E & & &  \\\\\n",
    "        & & A_W & A_P & A_E & & &  \\\\\n",
    "        & & & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots &  \\\\\n",
    "        & & & & A_W & A_P & A_E \\\\\n",
    "        & & & & & & ...\n",
    "    \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "This allows to fully specify the linear system, which can thus be solved.\n",
