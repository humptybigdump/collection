function [idx,D] = nearest_neighbor (Q,R)
% function [idx,D] = nearest_neighbor (Q,R)
%
% This function interprets Q and R as two sets of d-dimensional row vectors
% and calculates for each point in Q its closest neighbor in R (with
% respect the the Euclidean distance). It returns in idx for each vector in
% Q the index of the closest neighbor and in D the minimal distance.
