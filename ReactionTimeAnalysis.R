# A reaction time experiment was conducted involving 278 participants. 
# Demographics such as age, gender, and handedness were collected through an 
# introductory questionnaire. Participants were recruited randomly via mailing 
# lists and performed the tests online. Each participant performed the 
# experiment starting randomly with either auditory or visual cues, with five 
# trials for each cue type.
#
# define the variables of the experiment and their corresponding data type




# load the data and show the distributions of the demographics
# hint: the field participation_order should be ignored


# visualize the distribution of all reaction times depended on cue type

# find out if reaction times differ by cue tye, what is the Nullhypothesis?

# was the study well powered to state the results?


# visualize the reaction times depended on handedness

# find out if reaction times differ by handedness, what is the Nullhypothesis?

# was the study well powered to state the results?


# visualize reaction times of men and women

# find out if reaction times differ between men and women

# was the study well powered to state the results?
